How it works!

This app takes product and price and store it as well as calculate the total price of every product added.
In this app there are four types of discounts are available.
1. This discount is only for the employees of the store. They will get 30% discount in total.
2. This is for Affiliated customers they will get 10% of the total.
3. This is for the customers who are 2 years old customer of this store. They will get 5% of the total.
4. This is an special discount for the new customers. In this discount the user will get $5 discount on every $100 total.

One important thing is that only one discount is applicable at a time.

You need to select the type of customer you are (New customer, Employee of the store, Affiliated or 2 year old customer) 
Then after selecting the type of customer the discount will be applicable.
Add the product with price and name of the product. It will be added to the products array and you can see the total price, total discount and Net Payable amount.

This app is not attached with any back-end database or any API.
This is developed using only Angular
